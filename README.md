# Who made this?
The 3 exploits(triple_fetch+ziva+yalu) were made by Ian Beer, Adam Donenfeld, and Luca Todesco.
@cheesecakeufo complied all of them into one jailbreak :)

# Can I use it to jailbreak my device?
Saïgon be able to jailbreak all iOS devices running 10-10.2.1 (64-bit only).

# How do I run it?
I suggest using the .ipa version
If you insist, download the project then do the following:
1. Open 'Terminal'
2. cd into the project then run ./compile.sh
3. Open Impactor then drag the newly created .ipa into it
4. Install
4. Hit run and have fun!
